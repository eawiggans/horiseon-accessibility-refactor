# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor


## Description

This project looks at existing code for a webpage and makes the page more accessible for people using screen readers. This includes adding alt text to images and switching to semantic HTML to provide a more clear and descriptive experience for both screen reader-users and developers working on the code in the future.

## Usage

The webpage can be navigated with or without a screen reader and will appear as follows:

![screenshot of webpage](assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

and can be viewed live [here](urlgoeshere).
