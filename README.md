# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor


## Description

This project edited existing code for a webpage to makes the page more accessible for people using screen readers and more optimized for search engines. This includes adding alt text to images and switching to semantic HTML to provide a more clear and descriptive experience for both screen reader-users and developers working on the code in the future. The CSS style sheet was also simplified without changing the appearance or functionality of the page.

## Usage

The webpage can be navigated with or without a screen reader and will appear as follows:

and can be viewed live [here](https://eawiggans.github.io/horiseon-accessibility-refactor/).
